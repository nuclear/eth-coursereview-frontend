There is a chance that we can integrate the ETH login again but at the moment we depend on others to set it up.\n\nIn the meantime, you can still add reviews without authentication. This means you will not be able to edit them for now!\nThere is an option to provide a random string as an identifier when adding a review. Save this string somewhere safe, as you will need it to claim the review. That way you can edit or delete it again.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience and hope to have a proper authentication method again soon.",
